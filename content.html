<p>Heading tags in HTML provide a way to structure the page with large, bold text that indicates the hierarchy of the content. These tags have the format <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> represents the highest level heading and <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> the lowest. To use one of these tags, simply wrap the desired text within the appropriate opening and closing tags. For example, to create a level 2 heading, you would write: <code>&lt;h2&gt;Your Heading Here&lt;/h2&gt;</code>.</p>
    
The title at the top of this page is typically enclosed in an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag. The following are produced by the specified tag.</p>

<h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading Level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading Level 6</h6>

<p>As well as visually indicating the hierarchy of content, heading tags also describe the structure of the document for other tools, which can be useful for accessibility tools and search engine optimization.</p>
